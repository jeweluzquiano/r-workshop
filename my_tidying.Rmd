```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Attach packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

```

```{r}
inverts <- read_excel(here("data/inverts.xlsx"))

```
We can use the `tidyr` package and the `pivot_longer()` function to make the data into a longer format as opposed to a wide format.

```{r}
# Note: Either single-quotes, double-quotes, OR backticks around years work!

inverts_long <- pivot_longer(data = inverts, 
                                    cols = '2016':'2018',
                                    names_to = "year",
                                    values_to = "sp_count")

inverts_long

class(inverts_long$year)

# it's character, but needs to be numeric!

# Coerce "year" class to numeric and overwrite data frame and existing year column

inverts_long <- inverts_long %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

class(inverts_long$year)
```

We can also use `tidyr::pivot_wider` to do the opposite.

```{r}
inverts_wide <- inverts_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = common_name,
              values_from = sp_count)
```

Clean up the names with the `janitor::clean_names()` function!

```{r}
inverts_wide <- inverts_wide %>% 
  clean_names()
names(inverts_wide)
```

We can also use unite and separate functions

```{r}
## unite columns in inverts_long
inverts_unite <- inverts_long %>% 
  unite(col = "site_year", # this is the name of the new column
        c(site, year), # the columns we will unite
        sep = "_") # this specifies the delimiter
